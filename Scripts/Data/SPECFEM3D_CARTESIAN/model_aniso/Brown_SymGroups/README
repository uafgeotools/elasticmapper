This folder contains SPECFEM3D_cartesian model_aniso.f90 files with models belonging to
different symmetry classes generated from the Brown2016 map. The Brown2016 map and its
closest maps belonging to different symmetry groups are defined in the model files below.

model_aniso_ISO.f90 --> closest isotropic map to the Brown2016 map
model_aniso_XISO.f90 --> closest transversely isotropic map to the Brown2016 map 
model_aniso_TET.f90 --> closest tetragonal map to the Brown2016 map
model_aniso_ORTH.f90 --> closest orthorhombic map to the Brown2016 map
model_aniso_MONO.f90 --> closest monoclinic map to the Brown2016 map
model_aniso_TRIV.f90 --> Brown2016 map

model_aniso_ISO_XISO.f90 --> map halfway between model_aniso_ISO and model_aniso_XISO
model_aniso_XISO_TET.f90 --> map halfway between model_aniso_XISO and model_aniso_TET
model_aniso_TET_ORTH.f90 --> map halfway between model_aniso_TET and model_aniso_ORTH
model_aniso_ORTH_MONO.f90 --> map halfway between model_aniso_ORTH and model_aniso_MONO
model_aniso_MONO_TRIV.f90 --> map halfway between model_aniso_MONO and model_aniso_TRIV

To use one of these models in SPECFEM simulations -
1. Copy the file of interest into the SPECFEM source code folder
   src/generate_databases/ and rename the file as model_aniso.f90
2. In the Par_file set the flag ANISOTROPY = .true.
3. In the Mesh_Par_file while setting the material definition for the anisotropic
   material set the anisotropy flag to 2

These models were generated using the notebook -
https://github.com/uafgeotools/elasticmapper/blob/master/Scripts/Seismograms/models_for_specfem.ipynb

Note:

- The generated model parameter values were multiplied by a factor of 10^9 before
  being written into the model_aniso_*.f90 files to make them consistent with the
  Brown et al. 2016 paper.
