This folder contains SPECFEM3D_cartesian model_aniso.f90 files with different 
anisotropic models generated from the Brown2016 map. Linear interpolation (and 
extrapolation) is used to generate maps between (and outside) the closest 
isotropic map to the Brown2016 map and the Brown2016 map. 

model_aniso_t00.f90 --> closest isotropic map to Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t10.f90 --> map with 10% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t20.f90 --> map with 20% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t30.f90 --> map with 30% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t40.f90 --> map with 40% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t50.f90 --> map with 50% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t60.f90 --> map with 60% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t70.f90 --> map with 70% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t80.f90 --> map with 80% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t90.f90 --> map with 90% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t100.f90 --> Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t110.f90 --> map with 110% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t120.f90 --> map with 120% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t130.f90 --> map with 130% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t140.f90 --> map with 140% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t150.f90 --> map with 150% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t160.f90 --> map with 160% anisotropy of Brown2016 map

To use one of these models in SPECFEM simulations -
1. Copy the file of interest into the SPECFEM source code folder
   src/generate_databases/ and rename the file as model_aniso.f90
2. In the Par_file set the flag ANISOTROPY = .true.
3. In the Mesh_Par_file while setting the material definition for the anisotropic
   material set the anisotropy flag to 2

These models were generated using the notebook -
https://github.com/uafgeotools/elasticmapper/blob/master/Scripts/Seismograms/models_for_specfem.ipynb

Note:

- The generated model parameter values were multiplied by a factor of 10^9 before
  being written into the model_aniso_*.f90 files to make them consistent with the
  Brown et al. 2016 paper.
