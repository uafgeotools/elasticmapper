This folder contains SPECFEM3D_cartesian model_aniso.f90 files with different
anisotropic models generated from the Brown2016 map. Linear interpolation is
used to generate maps between the closest isotropic map to the Brown2016 map
and the map with 20% anisotropy of the Brown2016 map. 

model_aniso_t00.f90   --> closest isotropic map to Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t2_5.f90  --> map with  2.5% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t5.f90    --> map with  5.0% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t7_5.f90  --> map with  7.5% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t10.f90   --> map with 10.0% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t12_5.f90 --> map with 12.5% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t15.f90   --> map with 15.0% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t17_5.f90 --> map with 17.5% anisotropy of Brown2016 map
model_aniso_t20.f90   --> map with 20.0% anisotropy of Brown2016 map

To use one of these models in SPECFEM simulations -
1. Copy the file of interest into the SPECFEM source code folder
   src/generate_databases/ and rename the file as model_aniso.f90
2. In the Par_file set the flag ANISOTROPY = .true.
3. In the Mesh_Par_file while setting the material definition for the anisotropic
   material set the anisotropy flag to 2

These models were generated using the notebook -
https://github.com/uafgeotools/elasticmapper/blob/master/Scripts/Seismograms/models_for_specfem.ipynb

Note:

- The generated model parameter values were multiplied by a factor of 10^9 before
  being written into the model_aniso_*.f90 files to make them consistent with the
  Brown et al. 2016 paper.
